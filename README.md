      * `nvim -c "CocInstall <args>" or :CocInstall <args>`

### Manual OSX Settings

OSX defaults can change often with upgrades, not worth maintaining this section over the years in ansible

1. Apply SauceCodePro Nerd Font Semibold in iterm -> profile settings
2. iterm2 > preferences > profiles > colors > color presets > import > material-design-colors.itermcolors
3. In Iterm2 preferences -> Keys -> have "cmd/" send "++" to comment out and uncomment using the nerdcommenter extension quickly
4. Other OSX settings:
    * Automatically hide dock
    * General -> Show Scroll Bars -> Always
    * General -> Default Browser -> Brave
    * General -> Uncheck -> Close Windows when quitting an app
    * General -> Uncheck -> Allow Handoff between this mac and other devices
    * Security & Privacy -> Require password immediately after sleep
    * Display -> Uncheck -> Automatically adjust brightness
    * Display -> Uncheck -> True Tone
    * Display -> Nightshift -> Custom
    * Trackpad -> Point & Click -> Secondary Click -> Click in bottom right corner

    * Mouse -> Point & Click -> Uncheck -> Scroll Direction Natural
    * Mouse -> Point & Click -> Check -> Secondary click on right side
    * Tracking Speed 5 for both mouse and trackpad
5. Setup SSH keys for work and/or personal repositories
6. Open on login preferences:
    * Google Backup and Sync
    * Alfred
    * Amethyst
    * Coffee Buzz
    * Pock

### Manual App Store Only Installs
1. Todoist
2. Coffee Buzz
3. Be Focused Pro

### Troubleshooting
1. Path in .zshrc, `export ZSH=` might need to be updated if username doesn't match personal
2. ansible_python_interpreter var would need to be updated if python3 isn't in /usr/bin/python3
3. May need to run the command `pip3 install -U neovim` for pynvim interpreter to work
4. Run `:checkhealth` in vim to ensure everything is working smoothly
5. `CocInstall` and `GoInstallBinaries` sometimes seems to not work, re-run those two commands if
that's the case.
6. Use `:PlugUpdate` or `:CocUpdate` to update extensions and plugins. May need to run `:source %` before
